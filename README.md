# Jools Barnett - Front End Developer

Hi there! I'm Jools Barnett and I'm a frontend web developer. Though,
you've probably already figured that out.

I specialise in React (specifically Next.js) and I'm on the lookout
for a job as a junior developer. I'm also full stack capable, with a
real passion for creative problem solving.
